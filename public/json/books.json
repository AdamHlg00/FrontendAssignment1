    "description": "Bootstrap is not a programming language, nor is it really a computer language on its own. It’s a framework providing developers with pre-designed CSS, HTML, and JavaScript components to use when developing web pages. The creators of Bootstrap have created useful components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and reduced them to keywords or “classes” in their framework. For example, when using the Bootstrap framework, you can add a simple syntax for a button (syntaxes can be found on their web site) and a fully-fledged button with shape, color, and functions will appear. All you will have to specify yourself is what the button shall do and where it should be. There is no need for you to spend time on creating a button design in CSS and creating functions for it in JavaScript. Bootstrap can be compared to Lego, if you will. When building with Lego, there is no need for you to mold and color the plastic bricks yourself. Lego provides you with their ready-made bricks of different shapes and colors, and you can just mix and match them into whichever shape or structure you want. The same principle applies to Bootstrap, the creators have already gone through the trouble of creating useful components so that you will not have to. All you’ll have to do is use the Bootstrap framework and use the correct keywords. This eases the workload of web developers by a huge amount. Creating components like buttons from scratch every time would be very time consuming and likely turn out to be redundant work, since the same things will have to be repeated for each website you build."

    "description": "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard computer language used to create websites nowadays. It consists of elements used to give text on a website different meaning. Some people don’t consider HTML to be a programming language because it does not have variables, loops, and other traditional programming logic. A markup language is used to add additional information and annotate text documents, instead of performing different logical operations like traditional programming languages. Markup languages are used to describe the structure of a document. HTML is used to create the fundamental layout, structure, and content of websites. The content HTML can show includes text, images, links, etc. and elements are used to describe which pieces of content should be viewed as headers, sub headers, paragraphs, and other structuring items. Attributes with values can be assigned to pieces of content to group them together and make work easier when using additional languages. HTML is also used to control in which order and where the content should be displayed, creating the basic layout of the website. HTML can be seen as the skeleton of a website. It is supposed to be this robust scaffolding, describing the general shape of the website, that other languages or libraries can grab onto and refer to when executing their own code to further manipulate the content of the website. Today, while HTML can provide presentation design to a website, it is not used to describe more intricate designs, since its presentation capability is rather rudimentary compared to what other languages, specifically designed for designing presentation of websites, can do. Further designing of websites, past very basic things, are usually left to other languages more suited to designing the presentation of webpages like CSS or SCSS."

    "description": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a computer language used to create the visual presentation of websites. CSS is used to describe and control the visual appearance of a website. In practice, the language builds on a foundation created by HTML, taking the content, attribute values, and elements and can transform the visual look of everything. It’s a language created with website styling in mind, considering that’s its primary purpose, and provides users with a wide arsenal of styling options. With CSS you can do everything from simply setting the background color to adding gradients or transparency effects. You can create responsive layouts that adapt to your screen size, add shadow effects to elements, or create animations to draw attention to certain parts of your page. With CSS, the possibilities are endless and has therefore become one of the corner stones of web development. CSS also solves a big problem for web designers, the problem of standardized designs across multiple webpages. Before CSS you had to describe the visual design of a webpage in each webpage file using HTML, even if all webpages were to have the same layout and colors. With CSS, you’re able to gather all the information about presentation in one or multiple files, and then link to those CSS files in the HTML files containing the structure. This way, code will not have to be repeated to design multiple websites, since each website will refer to the same CSS file or files."

    "description": "JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to create more interactive web pages. JavaScript is used to create responsive, dynamic websites and can be described as the “brain” of a web page. It’s an interpreted language, meaning it’s read by an interpreter instead of a compiler when running. An interpreter translates and runs code line by line, whereas compilers translate all lines of code before running. JavaScript is also an asynchronous language, meaning certain lines of code can execute simultaneously instead of having to wait until the lines coming before them are done. The asynchronous attribute of JavaScript makes it stand out against many other programming languages and can lead to some confusion if you’re not used to working with synchronous code. Luckily, JavaScript provides ways to easily handle asynchronous operations. When used in web development, JavaScript can provide a whole host of useful functions, from responsive buttons to changing the appearance of the web page. It can gather information a user typed into textboxes and send it to a database, or it can get data from databases and display it on the web page. These are just a few of the functions JavaScript can be used for and there are many more available. JavaScript excels at responding to user actions due to the fact that it’s a client-side scripting language. It’s executed by the user’s web browser rather than the server itself, allowing for better interactivity. Even though its name “JavaScript” has “Java” in it, it’s actually not related or connected to Java at all. They have different syntax and different purposes, and the name is simply a result of the creator wanting to ride the wave of Java’s success."
